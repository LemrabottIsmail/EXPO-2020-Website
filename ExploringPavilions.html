  <figcaption> If you had the chance to visit one pavilion, we highly suggest visiting <b>Japan</b>. The pavilion shows
  its wonderful architecture with its origami-inspired design. The architecture looks humble and unique
compared to other color-loaded pavilions. In addition, simplicity is the main key &#128273; in building the architecture of the Japan Pavilion. </figcaption> <br><br><br><br> </td>
    <td> <a href = "https://www.expo2020dubai.com/en/understanding-expo/participants/country-pavilions/uae"> <img class = "explore" src = "Images_Project/uae.jpg"></a>
      <figcaption><b> UAE's pavilion</b> is the biggest pavilion in Expo2020 and they made sure their pavilion
        will stand out from the crowd. The design of the pavilion is inspired by the falcon wings. The architecture
      of the pavilion symbolizes <b>bold and daring spirit</b>. Also, it resembles a falcon in flight and highlights
    the history of falconry in the UAE.</figcaption><br><br><br><br></td>

    the eyes &#128064;. We recommend everyone to visit this pavilion as it reflects wonderful colors on its gigantic mirror at night &#127747;.
    In fact, the Saudi Arabia Pavilion is one of the biggest pavilions as it takes up an area of the size of two football fields! &#127944;

      <figcaption> <b>The United Kingdom pavilion</b> is known for its cone-shaped as it displays random words
        on the face of the building. The words are actually an AI-generated poem showcasing an intriguing presentation.
        The pavilion also highlights the importance of algorithms and AI technology. The words displayed on the
        building are words submitted by exhibition visitors. Moreover, an AI advanced technology is used to generate
        the words on the face of the building.

      <figcaption> If you are looking for the best presentation at Expo2020, you should definitely visit
        the <b>Switzerland pavilion</b>. The pavilion is built using a large reflective mirror that reflects
          the country's flag and can be seen from afar. Also, visitors are handed red umbrellas with special drawings
          to take a picture with. Furthermore, visitors have to walk through the fog &#127787; once they enter the pavilion and
          have a sense of the beauty of the country. &#10024;
